JWT Explanation

 What is JWT Token
 A JSON Web Token is a compact URL SAFE üîí means of representing `claims` to be transferred between two parties
 the client and the server.

 The claims in JWT are encoded as JSON objects which are literally signed using a JSON Web signature

 Explanation
 The Decoded JWT consists of three parts

 A. HEADER
 This consists of
 - The type of signing algorithm used by the token {"alg": "HS256", ...}
 - It also holds the type of the token {..., "typ": "JWT"}
 ‚≠ê It is held in the first part of the Token

 B. PAYLOAD
 The payload consists of the claims. Claims are statements about an Entity, typically the User.
 ‚≠ê It is held in the middle part of the Token
 ------. eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9 . ------

 There are 3 types of claims
 - Registered Claims:
 These are a set of predefined claims which are not mandatory but recommended to provide
 a set of useful claims. ISS, Subject, ODD, EXP etc...
 - Public Claims:
 These are claims that are defined within the IA & A JSON Web Token Registry or public by nature
 - Private Claims:
 These are custom claims to share information between parties that agree to use them


 C. VERIFY SIGNATURE
 This is used to verify that the center of the jwt token is who they claim to be and it
 ensures that the message wasn't changed along the way
 ‚≠ê It is held in the last part of the Token

 NOW THAT WE HAVE A BASIC understanding of JWT Tokens. We can start implementing them
